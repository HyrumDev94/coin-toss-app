# Render Streamlit App

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy an interactive web app using Streamlit. The app simulates coin tosses in real-time, tracks outcomes, and visualizes probability trends. Itâ€™s designed to showcase fundamental principles of randomness, probability, and user interaction in a clean, data-driven interface.

## Goal

To develop an interactive Streamlit application that visualizes the results of repeated coin tosses, allowing users to explore how probability stabilizes as the number of flips increases.

## Skills & Tools Used

- Programming: Python

- Framework: Streamlit

- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib / seaborn, numpy

- Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit Cloud

- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Project Workflow

- Simulation Logic:
Created a Python function that simulates coin tosses and returns results as a DataFrame.

- User Interface:
Built interactive buttons to control the number of tosses (e.g., 10, 100, 1 000).

- Visualization:
Displayed real-time results and plotted running probability of heads vs tails.

- Deployment:
Deployed the app using Streamlit Cloud, enabling live web access.
